# ProgrammingChallenges
# Never hestitate to relearn.

Solutions to some frequently asked Logical questions in interview.


# Java
* MaximumOccuring.java   - Number of times a character is present int a given String
* Recursivefact.java     - A recursive factorial program
* SlidingWindow.java     - Sliding window example to find a matching string
* SortedSquareClass.java - Square all numbers in a given array and sort them in order   
* TransposeMatrix.java   - Transpose a matrix multiple times

# Python
* Fiboeven.py            - function for sum of the first 100 even-valued Fibonacci numbers
* Sortedarray.py         - function for two sorted arrays of integers returns an array of any numbers which appear in both.
* Mulitplyandadd.py      - function when passed a decimal digit X, returns the value of X+XX+XXX+XXXX.
* Generate.py            - f(0) returns []
                            f(1) returns [[1]]
                            f(2) returns [[1], [1,2]]
                            f(3) returns [[1], [1,2], [1,2,3]]
                            etc.
